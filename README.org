First goal is to port the TGA code, just enough to generate the example image
with the red dot. I could vendor this in and directly call the C++ code from
zig, but likely a better goal for learning zig to port.

I first start off by copying a flake.nix I had from an earlier project which
provides the latest zig. I then just ran =zig init-exe= and started hacking.

Interesting things are that =const= means that all bytes related to that
variable are immutable. This is unlike other languages and actually makes a
lot of sense. So I had to use var on the array I created for the TGA file. I
used Cody to work this out, I am starting to see the value of AI tools.

I spent a long time before this jumping back and forth between the zig learn
site, zig std library code and my editor. I think I am gonna experiment with
AI tools to help me write correct code. Additionally I need to go back over
the code and try and use things like memmove/memcopy in places.

After an hour I had something which wrote out stuff to disk, but was not the
TGA file format. Next time I will try make the file correct.

**** Buggy TGA writer [2023-07-24 Mon 21:55]

Only had 30min tonight, but have a rendering TGA file which looks buggy as
hell. Tomorrow I will have to compare hexdump output of this TGA writer vs the
reference one.

It was quite amazing though, I pasted in the TGAHeader struct from C++ into
Cody to translate and it did a great job, including =packed struct= to match
the pragma used in the C++ code! I think I could of pasted in all the code and
it would of done a decent job, but then I refrained since I wouldn't learn as
much that way.
